“Not much, she seems like a geek. She spends all her time in the library!”

“Maybe because she feels lonely. She’s new!” (Mean and negative meaning).

Example 2

“Let’s go Ted’s house party tonight! Everyone’s going to be there!”

“I wish I could, but I have to study for my finals!”

“Ah, man, you’re such a geek!” (Fun and more playful meaning)



### Loser

在比赛中有赢家有输家，但是如果你的朋友说一个人是输家，这并不意味着他们输掉了比赛，这说明由于他/她的行为举止他们并不喜欢她/他。

Example 

“Ray is such a loser for breaking up with Rebecca.”

“Yeah, I know, he’s never going to find a girl as good as her!”



### To be ripped

在日常的英语交流中ripped意为‘torn（撕）’。在俚语中，如果用ripped形容某个人，这说明他有强壮的肌肉和身体。

“He’s done something to himself! He totally ripped!”

“Didn’t you hear? Alex dumped her last night! Just don’t mention his name at all!”



### **To have a crush (on somebody)** 

表示一种强烈的情感，意为你被某人所以吸引并且不仅仅把他看做是你的朋友。如果某人迷恋你，同理，他们也非常喜欢你，想要跟你有进一步的发展。

Instead of saying have a crush you can also just say crushing on – it means the same thing but it’s usually used among the younger generation and  teenagers.

“I am not! We’re just friends!”

“Me too, I’m amped.” 

It can also mean you’re really determined and you want something to  happen. With this meaning you can also replace amped with pumped.

它还有一层词意就是你真的做好决定了并且你确定你期待这件事的发生。有了这层含义你可以用pumped来替换amped。

Example 2

“Yeah, I’m sure you are!.”

### To chill out

意为放松，休息。通常情况下，你如果和一个以英语为母语的人交谈out可加可不加，他们完全够能够明白你在说什么。

Example 1

“Hey Tommy, what are you guys doing?” 

“We’re just chilling (out).”

Example 2

“Sue, what did you do in the weekend?”

“Nothing much. We just chilled (out).” 

But if someone tells you need to chill out it’s not as positive. It means  that they think you’re overreacting to a situation or getting stressed  about silly little things.

但是如果有人说你需要chill out,那么这就不是积极的意义了，这意为你对环境过度反应了或者你对一些微小的事情太在意了。

 Example 3

“I can’t believe that test we just had. I’m sure I’m going to fail.”

“You need to chill out and stop thinking too much. I’m sure you’ll be fine.” 



### To hang out

如果有人问你通常在哪闲逛，他们是想知道当你有时间的时候，你通常都喜欢去哪。如果你的朋友问你你是否能和他们一起出去闲逛，他们其实是在问你是否有时间并且愿意和他们一起出去。

Example 1

“Hi Simon, what are you doing?”

“Nothing much, just hanging out with Sally.” 

Example 2

“Joey, where are you, guys.”

“We’re at our usual hang out. Come down whenever you want!” 



### To be beat

在正常的术语里，beat通常采用词义‘赢’或者‘打’的意思。在俚语或者日常英语中，意为他/她非常累了或者筋疲力尽了。

Example 1

“Do you want to go out tonight? There’s a cool new rock bar that’s just opened.”

“Sorry, I can’t. I’m beat and I have to wake up early tomorrow.”

Example 2

“You look beat, what have you been doing?”

“I’ve been helping my dad in the yard all morning.”



### Cool

Cool和awesome一样意为‘很棒的’或者‘极好的’，说明你同意这个想法。正常意为有一点冷，因此使用cool的时候你必须认真听并且根据语境去理解词义。

Example 1

“How’s the weather in Canada these days?”

“It’s getting cooler. Winter’s coming!”

（这里是cool的字面含义，意味有一点冷）

Example 2

“What did you think of my new boyfriend?”

“I liked him. He seemed like a cool guy!” 

（他是一个好人）

“I’ll pick you up at 1 pm, okay?”

“Awesome.”
