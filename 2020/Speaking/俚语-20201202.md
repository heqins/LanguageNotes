“Not much, she seems like a geek. She spends all her time in the library!”

“Maybe because she feels lonely. She’s new!” (Mean and negative meaning).

Example 2

“Let’s go Ted’s house party tonight! Everyone’s going to be there!”

“I wish I could, but I have to study for my finals!”

“Ah, man, you’re such a geek!” (Fun and more playful meaning)



### Loser

在比赛中有赢家有输家，但是如果你的朋友说一个人是输家，这并不意味着他们输掉了比赛，这说明由于他/她的行为举止他们并不喜欢她/他。

Example 

“Ray is such a loser for breaking up with Rebecca.”

“Yeah, I know, he’s never going to find a girl as good as her!”
